## About
This is a side project I did while attending Prime Digital Academy.  One of our weekend assignments (about three weeks into the classroom curriculum) was to build a full-stack application by following a set of instructions.  I completed this assignment much faster than I had anticipated (results here: https://github.com/sasham43/basic_walking_skeleton) and I wanted to take a slightly deeper dive into all the mechanics I had just stitched together.  I built this application, which uses the OMDB API to search for movies, which can then be saved to a users' database.  The intention was to practice all the aspects of a full-stack application, and gain a better understanding of how they fit togehter.
